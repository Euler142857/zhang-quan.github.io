Suppose we are given the stochastic differential equation 

$dX_t = u_t dt + \sigma_t dB_t$,

we know that

$df = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + u_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right) dt + \sigma_t \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dB_t$.
